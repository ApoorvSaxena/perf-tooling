"grunt-phantomas is a Grunt.js task that aggregates Phantomas data and produces graphs so you can see trends."

It is extremely configurable and allows you to show as little or much of the Phantomas data as you want. It also allows you to visualize any assertions you've set, to help track performance budgets.
